<br><u>**How to use Ansible Build**</u>
<br>
These Ansible scripts have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the ansible YML script file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.<br>

<u>**High Availability**</u> : Load balancing ensures that the application will be high availability. Load Balancer is put in with two webservers ( web-1 & Web-2) in backend pool, with a health probe to monitor the webservers hosting DVWA (D*am Vulnerable Web Application). Loadbalancer public IP fronts and restrict network access. <br>

Primary function of a load balancer is to spread workloads across multiple servers to prevent overloading servers, optimize productivity, and maximize uptime. Load balancers also add resiliency by rerouting live traffic from one server to another if a server falls prey to DDoS attacks or otherwise becomes unavailable. In this way, load balancers help to eliminate single points of failure, reduce the attack surface, and make it harder to exhaust resources and saturate links.

We also have a Jumpbox server which act as a gateway.A jump server, jump host or jump box is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. A jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them. In our setup, access policies only allow inbound ssh connections to jumpbox and not to any other VM, thus preventing exposure.


Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and system traffic.

<u>**Filebeat & Metricbeat**</u><br>
Installed as an agent on our webservers ( Web-1 and Web-2), Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that we specify, collects log events, and forwards them to Elasticsearch / logstash for indexing
Metricbeat is also installed as agent on our webservers (Web-1 and Web-2),  it collects system-level CPU usage, memory, file system, disk IO, and network IO statistics, as well as top-like statistics for every process running



<br>Access Policies
=======

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet.
Only the Jumpserver machine(Jump-Box-Provisioner) can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses: 103.140.129.87,49.36.167.231

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jumpserver server:<br>
Jump-Box-Provisioner (10.0.1.4)


A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.<br>

Elk Configuration
Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because it dramatically improves the scalability, consistency, and reliability of your IT environment.It can manage the infrastructure, networks, operating systems and services that we are already using. Ansible provides Orchestration in the sense of aligning the business request with the applications, data, and infrastructure

The playbook implements the following tasks:

TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc.<br>  
1- Install Docker<br> 
2- Install Python<br> 
3- Ensure /Increase Virtual memory to 262144<br>
4- Download and configure docker ELK container to start and use ports 5601,9200,5044.<br> 

<u>**DONE TILL HERE**<br> </u> 
The following screenshot displays the result of running docker ps after successfully configuring the ELK instance.
Note: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace docker_ps_output.png with the name of your screenshot image file.


Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:

TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:

TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., Winlogbeat collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc.


Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned:
SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:

Copy the _____ file to _____.
Update the _____ file to include...
Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:

Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?
Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?
_Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

As a Bonus, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc.
